Problem Statement:
There is no denying that air pollution is impacting nature and the climate. 
An Air Quality index value above 100 translates to very unhealthy air quality conditions for survival, 
with high levels of health concern. We are working on a "Air Quality Index Prediction" model 
using Webscrapping and Machine learning/ Deep learning concepts to predict the air pollution 
index based on the historical data provided to help the government to administer the same.

Solution :
    Developed a Air Quality Index Prediciton Model by using Webscrapping and Machine Learning and
    Deep Learning concept.
    Data collection from the website - http://en.tutiempo.net/climate
    
Trained our model in below Algorithms. Here we see that "RandomForestRegressor" is giving
us the best accuracy. so for our model this algorithm is the best.

Linear Regression = 0.4710569304807393

KNNRegressor = 0.39387489016756577

RandomForestRegressor = 0.7078763563047866

KNeighborsRegressor = 0.39387489016756577

XgboostRegressor = 0.6582827367763413
